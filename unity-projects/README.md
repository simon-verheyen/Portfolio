# Unity projects

Folder containing old unity projects, writen in C#.
Most are small games that are playable, except for the solar system simulator.
these have been build using the unity engine's physics engine as well as multiple other features.

Only the cave generator being more script heavy, where unity is more used to visualise while the scripts, in C#, are doing the heavy lifting.

C# scripts can be found in every project folder in the subfolder: assets/scripts
