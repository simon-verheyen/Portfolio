# Neural network projects

This folder containing some of my personal projects surrounding neural networks.

### ANN_C (C)
This was to test practice my proficienty with C by an attempt to code a functional neural network from scratch.
The project is near complete, only the destruction of the NN, through deallocation of memory, needs to be implimented.
  
### Flappy AI (Python)
This is a project where i first created a rudamentairy version of the game 'Flappy Birds' in python.
After which I connect it to a population of neural networks who can learn to play the game in some 15 generations through a genetic learning algorithm 

(Inspired by code-bullet on youtube)
  
### Dino Run (Python)
This is a project where i first created a rudamentairy version of the game 'Dino Run' from the google browser in python.
After which I connect it to a population of neural networks who can learn to play the game in some 15 generations through a genetic learning algorithm

### ML course project
This was the end project for my machine learning course in university where we use the sklearn library in python to analyse data on the energy consumption and production of an unnamed country to create a functional prediction models and compare their accuracy.
In my case I trained a k-neirest neighbours model and a neural net.
