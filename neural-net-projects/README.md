# Neural network projects

This folder containing some of my personal projects surrounding neural networks.

### ANN_C (C)
  This was to test practice my proficienty with C by an attempt to code a functional neural network from scratch.
  The project is near complete, only the destruction of the NN, through deallocation of memory, needs to be implimented.
  
### Flappy AI (Python)
  This is a project where i first created a rudamentairy version of the game 'Flappy Birds' in python.
  After which I connect it to a population of neural networks who can learn to play the game in some 15 generations through a genetic learning algorithm 
  (Inspired by code-bullet on youtube)
  
### Dino Run (Python)
  This is a project where i first created a rudamentairy version of the game 'Dino Run' from the google browser in python.
  After which I connect it to a population of neural networks who can learn to play the game in some 15 generations through a genetic learning algorithm
