COVID-19 Data visualization and analysis
---

This directory contains an ongoing process in an attempt to visualise, on a daily basis, the collected data on the outbreak in an accessible way.<br>
The project consists of a set of Jupyter notebook worksheets that run every day to process and visualise the daily new information. 
The data is collected and provided by the [ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide).

Please note that this is an ongoing project. Which means that not all content is implemented yet and the structure or explanations are subject to change.

Any input on improvements and interesting graphs or groups to be shown are more than welcome!

###  Data-Extraction:

### Visualization: 

This is the main directory for viewers, containing the worksheets that visualise and show the data.

### Data:
