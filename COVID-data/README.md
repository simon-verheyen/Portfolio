COVID-19 Data visualization and analysis
---

This directory contains an ongoing process in an attempt to provide readers with the insight needed to interpret graph and data surounding the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as to try and analyse the data to extract usefull information as the crisis continues.<br>
The data is collected and provided by the [ECDC (European Centre for Desease Prevention and Control)](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide).

Please note that this is an ongoing project. Which means some of the planned content is not implimented yet and the explanations are subject to change. Though through daily updates, hopefully we'll get there.

###  Data-Extraction: 

Contains two jupyter notebooks which collect the data and process it in the datasets used for this project. These are run once a day when the ECDC provides their daily updated datasheet.<br>
For those who are interested there are explanations throughout explaining the process.

### Visualization: 

This is the main directory for viewers, containing the notebooks that visualise and explain the data.

### Data: 

Contains all the datasets, which can be opened and viewed in their entity.
