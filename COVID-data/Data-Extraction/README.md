# Data Extraction and Processing

Downloading and processing is split up into two notebooks. This is done since we show parts of the datasets throughout, for transparency, but this can create very long pages.<br>
The process is explained throughout. Though the explanation becomes less detailed as it progresses considering the core process doesn't change.

### Data-Download

Downloads the [ECDC datasheet](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) and makes the first three datasets.

### Data-Processing.ipynb 

Uses the three sets created by it's companion and creates all the other datasets.
