# Data Extraction and Processing

This directory contains two worksheets that are responsible for downloading and processing the data.
This split is made since we show sections of the datasets throughout, for transparency. Which can create very long pages.<br>
The process is explained throughout. Though the explanation becomes less detailed as it progresses considering the core process doesn't change.

### Data-Download

Downloads the [ECDC datasheet](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) and makes the first three data sets.

### Data-Processing.ipynb 

Uses the three sets created by it's companion worksheet to creates all the other data sets.
