# Portfolio: Simon Verheyen

This repository is made as a showcase of a selection of the projects I have completed over the year.
My resume can be found in this repository as well.


### COVID-data:

  This is my ongoing project on the COVID-19 pendemic. Here I started collecting daily updated data about the outbreak, which I will try to visualise and train models on.

### gapminder-project:

  This was my latest project where I use data collected from gapminder.org and use this to practice using, as well as        set up my own, tools for processing and visualising large datasets.
  As well as creating my own artifical neural net architecture for training a predictive neural network using gradient descent with multiple reularization and optimization techniques.
  
  Though this project is put on hold after the COVID-19 outbreak.

### neural-net-projects:

  This contains a few small projects around setting up and training neural networks, with structured data as well as reinforcement learning.

### unity-projects:

  This contains small projects and game created in the unity editor, from simulations to small game. Used to showcase proficiancy with physics engines as well as C# scripting.
