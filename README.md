This repository is made as a showcase of a selection of the projects I have completed over the year.

### gapminder-project:

  This is my latest ongoing project where I use data collected from gapminder.org and use this to practice using, as well as        set up my own, tools for processing, visualising and analysing large datasets.

### neural-nets-projects:

  This contains a few small projects around setting up and training neural networks, with structured data as well as reinforcement learning.

### unity-projects:

  This contains small projects and game created in the unity editor, from simulations to small game
