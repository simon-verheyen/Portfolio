Folder containing most of my personal projects surounding neural networks.

ANN_C (C): 
  Creating a functional neural network from scratch in C coding language as test for my understanding of the language.
  The project is near complete, only the destruction of the NN, through deallocation of memory, needs to be implimented
  
Flappy AI (Python):
  Self created version of flappy birds, connected to a population of neural networks that learn the game through a genetic learning algoritmn.
  All code is self writen with knowledge from courses
  
Dino Run (Python):
  Self created version of Dino Run (the chrome game),  connected to a population of neural networks that learn the game through a genetic learning algoritmn.
  All code is self writen with knowledge from courses
