Containg projects related to data analysis.

gapminder-project is my ongoing project for processing and eventually predicting data pulled from gapminder, an open source global data distributor.

ML-counrse-project is my last uni project where I analyse data about energy consumption and creation of an unnamed country to train a model that can predict energy consumption.
